Hello gitters.

I am a willful prisoner of the Microsoft stack; riding the enterprise ship because it is so comfortable and it pays the bills.  That helps.  But am eager to jump ship on the rare times that I have spare minutes to learn about Linux, Docker, MongoDB and aspNet5.  I guess I really can't remove myself from Microsoft.  That's not all entirely a bad thing.

Broaden the horizon, that's all I am interested in.
